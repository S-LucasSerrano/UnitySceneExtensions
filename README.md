# Scene Management Extensions

This is the Unity package I use to manage scenes in my own projects. It includes:
- A useful editor window with a list of all the scenes in the Assets folder, with buttons to easily swap between them.
- Scriptable objects that hold a reference to a specific scene, with functions to load it from UI Buttons, Events or from your code. They allow to load scenes and maintain references to them even if you change their name or index in the build settings.
- Fading between scenes and an easy way to create new scene transitions.
- An easy way to create loading screens.

Check the package documentation to see all the things it can do for your project [here](https://lucasserrano.notion.site/Scene-Management-Extensions-20a48ff590c8423e87f6ecf0bd27aa8b).

### Installation
How to add the package to your project:

If you have git installed on your computer, from Untiy go to ``Window`` -> ``Package Manager`` -> ``+`` (top left) -> ``Add from Git Url`` and paste the URL to the git repo or the specific release you want.


If you don't have git installed, just download the code -by going to `<> Code` on the top right -> ``Download .zip``- and add it to your project haha.
