# Scene Management Extensions

This is the Unity package I use to manage scenes in my own games. It includes:
- A useful editor window with a list of all the scenes in the Assets folder, with buttons to easily swap between them.
- Scriptable objects that hold a reference to a scene, with functions that allow to load it from Buttons, Unity Events or from your code.
- Fading between scenes and an easy way to create new transitions.
 - An easy way to create a loading screen.
Check the package documentation to see all the things it can do for your project: *(the link will be here)*.

### Installation
How to add the package to your project: if you have git installed on your computer, from Untiy go to Window -> Package Manager -> + (top left) -> Add from Git Url and paste the URL of the git repo.

If you don't have git installed, just download the code and add it to your project haha.
